[3.69.33]

New/improved:
Version: Upgraded the whole code base to Blender 4.0, with armature collections support. Make sure to click "Update Armature" when opening rigs from older versions.
Version: Because Blender 4 removed the extra frame added at the end of actions frame range, added a new Legacy setting to back up this additional frame
Version: Blender 4 does not handle properly the double IK fingers constraints, leads to cyclic dependency (wobbly bones effect). Then, unfortunately the second IK at the tip of the fingers had to be removed. Click "Update Armature" when opening old rigs with IK fingers. Note, this second IK constraint could be restored later, will require more advanced bones mechanics to avoid the cyclic dependency.
Export: New Presets feature, to save and load export settings quickly
Export: FBX: Expose the "Force Start/End Keyframe"
Export: Clean up of the humanoid UE skeleton collections
Export: The Fbx and Gltf export operators were renamed, leading to change the script snippets in the documentation. Old name: "id.arp_export_fbx_panel", New: "arp.arp_export_fbx_panel"
Export: FBX: Exposed the Vertex Color space setting
Export: Mesh to mesh parenting is now preserved when exporting, and non-skinned children meshes parented to skinned meshes are exported as well
Export: Bones animations can now be exported with constant keyframe interpolation, using the "Set Const. Bones" button. Applies to all keyframes, all actions of given bones. Todo later: fine-tuning, in order to export only specific keyframes as constant.
Export: Added effective export time in the popup notification after export
Export: Humanoid export now supports more than 2 arms and feathers
Rig: The selected armature can now be saved as a custom preset automatically (it was already possible to add custom presets before, but the preset files had to created and put in the folder manually)
Rig: The custom presets armatures can be removed using a dedicated menu
Rig: Facial options: Slight change in the behavior of "Update Transforms" for eyelids. Now, eyelid bones are aligned automatically in a circular shape only if the amount was changed and this setting is turned on. Before, they were always aligned if the amount was changed, regardless of this setting.
Rig: Spline IK: New FK mode (Limb Options). Generate master FK controllers every Nth bones, by default locked to the IK masters amount for correct IK-FK snap. 
Rig: Spline IK: IK-FK switch and snap (Rig Main Properties). IK to FK snapping is accurate, but FK to IK is not by nature: compensating the smooth curve interpolation between control points is quite a technical challenge, to improve later if possible.
Rig: Spline IK: New "Update Vertex Groups Name" setting (Limb Options). If enabled, automatically renames the vertex groups of the deformed meshes, according to the latest changes in Spline IK Limb Options.
Rig: Armature Presets: Custom armature presets can now be stored in an external folder, as set in the addon preferences. Armature libraries can be added into this external folder, making it independent from the addon installation folder (custom armatures will not be deleted anymore when updating the addon). Custom presets files stored in the addon folder still remain.
Rig: Blink Pose: When removing the blink pose, a menu now prompts to remove the whole blink pose, or only in-between poses

Fixed:
Export: Error when actions contained a single frame only
Export: Scene Units set to None was crashing the export
Export: Actions with no "id_root" attributes were not exported
Export: Wrong mannequin bones axes orientation, because of hidden bones collections
Export: Shape keys animation as an NLA track did not export with "Apply Modifiers" setting enabled
Export: Error when exporting IK Splines with Blender 4
Export: Crash when no deforming bones are selected, while "Only Selected Bones" is enabled
Export: The "Set Universal Rig" function was missing custom script execution
Export: The Set/Unset export rig function could remove vertex groups when unsetting, if the vertex groups were not assigned to any vertices
Remap: Fixed unreported bug with collection visibility 
Version: "Show IK Direction" line broken in Blender 4
Version: "Update Armature" was not removing the second IK fingers constraint when the rig was already updated to Blender 4
Version: Move constraints operator broken in Blender 4, use lower level functions instead
Version: Some users report error when importing the Requests module (chardet import error), use urllib instead
Rig: Ensure bones custom shapes are assigned to the cs collection and parented to cs_grp
Rig Layers: Error (in console) when updating layers visibility while nothing is selected
Rig: Disable fingers Rot From Scale broken in Blender 4
Rig: Control and reference lips bones had incorrect colors in Edit mode
Rig: Error with Kilt limbs and single colliding leg 
Rig: The Kilt custom shapes were removed when editing more than one Kilt limb
Rig: New eyelid bones had no color
Rig: Legs IK poles roll was not aligned when Match to Rig. Added a Legacy setting for backward-compatibility
Smart: Error when removing an optional facial object from the detection
Smart: Error if facial objects are not assigned to any view layers
Smart: Removed any dead BGL call for MacOS compatibility
Skin: Bind crashing when an eye object was defined in Facial Features, but no eye bones found
CheckForUpdate: urllib request module import broken in latest python versions
Installation: Armature presets path crashing the addon install if the path does not exist yet
